# Credit_Card_Fraud_Kaggle
This repository contains the possible solutions to the Credit Card Fraud problem set in Kaggle. It contains EDA, including dimensionality reduction,visualisations, sampling techniques , synthetic oversampling. A contrastive k fold analysis of decision trees,neighbors classifier, regression and discriminant analysis along with their confusion matrices. Alternative solutions using boosting trees and forests(lightgbm classifiers) are also used. A neural network of 4 intermediate hidden odes with relu and sigmoid activations is also provided as an alternative approach to get a higher accuracy.

The dataset and benchmarks can be found here:https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud/
